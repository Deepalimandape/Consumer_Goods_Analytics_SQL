Project Title- SQL-Powered Business Insights for Management in the Consumer Goods Domain

Problem Statement- Atliq Hardwares struggles to make quick, data-driven decisions due to a lack of structured insights. To strengthen their data analytics capabilities, they plan to hire junior analysts with strong SQL and analytical skills. To evaluate candidates, Tony Sharma, the Data Analytics Director, has designed an SQL challenge to assess both technical expertise and business insight generation. This project aims to solve the challenge by deriving actionable insights for management.
